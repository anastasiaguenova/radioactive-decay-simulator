# Radioactive Decay Simulator

A simulator for radioactive decay to be used in physics class.

## Getting Started

To quickly start using the software on a windows machine, navigate to the "windows" folder and (using the green button on the right) download the project onto your personal computer. Once the download is complete, unzip the files and simply double click the "Radioactive Decay Simulator.exe" file.

If you want to contribute to the project I suggest you only clone the "electron" folder. You can then run the software by using npm start, assuming you already have node.js installed. 

### How it works

To use the software simply enter the starting number of nuclei and then either press the button next to the text field or the Enter key. Scroll down to see the results. 

### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites to run the software on a Windows machine. This version of the software doesn't support MacOS and Linux for the purpose of speeding up development. 

### Development

If you want to improve on the project you will need to install node.js and a suitable code editor such as Visual Studio Code. 
 
To run the project with node.js and npm, navigate to the "app" folder using a terminal and type:
```
npm start
```

## Motivation

This software was written to make physics experiments around the law for radioactive decay more accessible to physics teachers and students who may not otherwise have the means to carry them out at school.
